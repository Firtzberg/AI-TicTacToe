<h2>3 Projects</h2>
Development tool: Microsoft Visual Studio 2012<br />
The code is organized in 3 projects (inside one solution).<br />
<ul>
<li><strong>TicTacToeControl</strong> - Defines the custom controls (TicTacToeSquare and TicTacToeBoard) wich are Toolbox complatible, and some additional things</li>
<li><strong>TicTacToeAgent</strong> - Defines the Agent.</li>
<li><strong>TicTacToe</strong> - Defines the Form, its layout and behaviour. The form takes care of statistics.</li>
</ul>
I commented everything.<br />
Feel free to use it.
